# Get started with ParticuLog!

# About

This project was about having a portable small air quality sensor that is easy to use and carry around to measure and track polution levels in your area or on your commute, etc.

## Milestones
- A sensor device equipped with a PM sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, as well as a GPS module, all connected to a central microcontroller. 
- An Android app with user authentication that communicates with and controls the sensor device: starts/stops a session, collects data, upload data to cloud, and displays data in a graph and a map view. Firebase was used as the BaaS in this project. 

# Hardware

The microcontroller used was an ESP32 and the source code can be found in the `Hardware/src` folder, named `main.cpp`.
