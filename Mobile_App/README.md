# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev "https://expo.dev") project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app "https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app"). This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction "https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction").

## Get started

1. First make sure you have `node.js` installed. Visit their [website](https://nodejs.org/en "https://nodejs.org/en") and download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Run the installer to install `node.js` onto your laptop.

2. `cd` into this directory (`Mobile_App`), and run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install additional packages:

   - Styling & animation related packages:
      ```bash
      npm install nativewind tailwindcss react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context
      npm install @shopify/react-native-skia
      ```
   - Bluetooth related packages:
      ```bash
      npm install react-native-ble-plx @config-plugins/react-native-ble-plx
      ```
   - Android related packages:
      ```bash
      npm install expo-device react-native-base64
      ```
   - Packages for custom builds
      ```bash
      npm install eas-cli
      ```

4. Then run the following command in the directory `Mobile_App` to start the app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

5. In the terminal output, you'll see different options to open the app:

   - [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/ "https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/")
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/ "https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/")
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/ "https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/")
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go "https://expo.dev/go")
      - A limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
      - _**Easiest and simplest method**_ to test the app, download the Expo Go app for free from Google Play (Android) or App Store (Apple)
